# Dynamic Optical Test for Bot Identification (DOT-BI)
A simple check to identify bots in surveys and online processes.

# Please feel free to utilize one of the pre-rendered DOT-BI checks or generate your own.
Acknolwedgement would be highly appreciated: Bleeker, Gotsch, Reinecke (2025): Dynamic Optical Test for Bot Identification (DOT-BI): A simple check to identify bots in surveys and online processes.

# Use an existing DOT-BI Check:
1. In the folder "Pregenerated Checks" are hundreds of variants with different "numbers" to be identified.
2. Feel free to use them in your surveys or software (Note: In some cases, it might sense to rotate between different variants, to prevent predictiability.)
3. All the best. 

# Generate your own DOT-BI Check:
1. In the folder "Generate_Checks" are Jupyter Notebooks to generate your own DOT-BI Check.
2. Feel free to adjust the paramaters as need or also fundamentally change the script for your needs.
3. All the best.

# Thank you.
