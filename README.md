What a bot/an AI will see:

Explanation: Information is only contained in the relative change between frames, not in individual frames, and is therefore not visible to current state of the art models from e.g. MidJourney, OpenAI, Google. On the contrary, the values are easily detectable by human perception. Extensive testing is currently in progress and will be published soon.

## Please feel free to utilize one of the pre-rendered DOT-BI checks or generate your own.

## Use an existing DOT-BI Check:
1. In the folder **"Pregenerated Checks"** are hundreds of variants with different values to be identified.
2. Feel free to use them in your surveys or software (Note: In some cases, it might make sense to rotate between different variants to prevent predictability.)
3. All the best. 

## Generate your own DOT-BI Check:
1. In the folder **"Generate_Checks"** are Jupyter Notebooks to generate your own DOT-BI Check.
2. Feel free to adjust the parameters as needed or even fundamentally change the script for your needs.
3. All the best.

## Thank you.
