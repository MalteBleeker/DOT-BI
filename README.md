## Please feel free to utilize one of the pre-rendered DOT-BI checks or generate your own.

## Use an existing DOT-BI Check:
1. In the folder **"Pregenerated Checks"** are hundreds of variants with different values to be identified.
2. Feel free to use them in your surveys or software (Note: In some cases, it might make sense to rotate between different variants to prevent predictability.)
3. All the best. 

## Generate your own DOT-BI Check:
1. In the folder **"Generate_Checks"** are Jupyter Notebooks to generate your own DOT-BI Check.
2. Feel free to adjust the parameters as needed or even fundamentally change the script for your needs.
3. All the best.

## Thank you.
